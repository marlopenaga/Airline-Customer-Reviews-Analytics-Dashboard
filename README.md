# Airline Flight Review Dashboard

## Project Overview

This Tableau dashboard delivers a comprehensive analysis of **British Airways flight reviews worldwide**, leveraging data from **airlinereviews.csv** and **countries.csv** to uncover actionable insights that can drive strategic decision-making and enhance customer experience.

The dashboard presents four powerful visualizations:

1. **Service Quality Assessment**: Shows strong overall satisfaction (4.2/5) while identifying high-impact improvement opportunities in entertainment (1.4/5) and food service (2.4/5).

2. **Global Satisfaction Mapping**: Pinpoints regional performance variations, enabling market-specific strategies that can elevate British Airways' competitive positioning in key territories.

3. **Customer Satisfaction History**: Tracks critical satisfaction trends from 2016-2024, revealing both seasonal patterns and recent declines that demand attention.

4. **Aircraft Satisfaction Comparison**: Identifies the Boeing 747-400 as the customer favorite (4.7/5 rating) while highlighting improvement opportunities for lower-performing aircraft models like the A321.

This dashboard transforms customer feedback into strategic intelligence, enabling data-driven decisions that can elevate British Airways' market position through targeted service improvements and enhanced customer satisfaction.
